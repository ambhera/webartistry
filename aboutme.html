            <h2>Experiences</h2>
            <p>My name is Ambher Aquino, and for the last 2 years, I fell in love
                 with coding. I'm currently in an art school and I wanted to find
                  a way to really show people that even computers can make art. 
                  With everything me and my classmates have made throught our 
                  time together, I see that creative minds circulate everywhere.
                The ideas that my peers come up with amaze and facinate me, 
                motivating me to do my best and go all out with all the imaginitive
                 thoughts I think and feel. One example I can give is our 
                 workplace challenge at <a href="https://www.warbyparker.com/", id="Glasses">
                    Warby Parker</a>.</p>
