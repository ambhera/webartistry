            <h2>About</h2>
            <h3>General</h3>
            <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for 
                the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).
                [1] Web development can range from developing a simple single 
                static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic
                 businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive 
                 list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may 
                 include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, 
                 client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server 
                 and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>
            
            <p>Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the 
                main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and
                 coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems 
                 (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic
                  technical skills.</p>
                
            <p>For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams 
                can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow 
                standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web 
                sites.[1] Smaller organizations may only require a single 
                permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to 
                related job positions such as a graphic designer or information
                 systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative 
                 effort between departments rather than the domain of a 
                 designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer
                  specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and
                   full-stack developer.[3] Front-end developers are responsible
                    for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while
                     back-end developers deal with the servers.[4] 
                     Since the commercialization of the Web, the 
                     industry has boomed and has become one of the most
                      used technologies ever.</p>

            <p>In 1991, Berners-Lee introduced HTML (Hypertext Markup Language),
                 the fundamental language of the web. HTML allowed the structuring
                  of documents with hyperlinks, forming the basis of web pages.
                   The first-ever website, which explained the World Wide Web, 
                   went live in 1993.

            <p>CERN is not an isolated laboratory, but rather the focal point for
                 an extensive community that includes more than 17 000 scientists
                  from over 100 countries. Although they typically spend some
                   time on the CERN site, the scientists usually work at 
                   universities and national laboratories in their home
                    countries. Reliable communication tools are therefore 
                    essential.</p>
            <p>The basic idea of the WWW was to merge the evolving technologies 
                of computers, data networks and hypertext into a powerful and 
                easy to use global information system.</p>

                themselves." -Tim Berners-Lee</blockquote>
